# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- ite + React Project
This project is built using Vite as the build tool and ReactJS for the frontend. Vite provides a fast and optimized development environment, making it a great choice for React applications.

Features
Fast development server with HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
Optimized build with minimal configuration.
Supports React hooks and functional components.
Supports modern JavaScript features, such as ES Modules.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (v12.0 or later)
npm (v6.0 or later)
Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This will start the Vite development server and open the app in your browser.

Scripts
npm run dev: Starts the development server with hot-reloading.
npm run build: Builds the project for production.
npm run preview: Serves the built app for production preview.

Optimized Build: Vite pre-bundles dependencies using esbuild, ensuring a faster build process.
Modern JavaScript Support: Vite supports ES Modules out of the box, leading to improved performance.
Minimal Configuration: Vite provides a sensible default configuration with minimal setup required.
Known Issues
Browser Compatibility: Although Vite supports modern browsers, older browsers may require polyfills for full compatibility.
Build Size for Large Apps: While Vite is optimized for speed, large React applications may require additional configuration to optimize the build size.
